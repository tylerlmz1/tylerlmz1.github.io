### What is this blog about
I'm a software engineer by profession, and this is a personal blog to write Software Engineering content I find lacking on the internet.

When I'm trying to figure out how to do something software engineering related, I find it more convenient to search the web than to look into some book PDF, but the content I'm looking for isn't always available, or dispersed in multiple locations, this blog is an attempt to pave these muddy roads that I've walked, as an small attempt to contribute to the software engineering sphere.

In the hopes that the next person that stumbled across some problem that I've encountered before, can find the content they need when they google for it.

### Implementation

This is currently a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
