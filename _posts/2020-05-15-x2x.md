<!--Control two Linux computers side-by-side with one set of mouse and keyboard with x2x.-->

Let's say you have two Linux computers, and want to control both of them with only one set of keyboard and mouse, you can do this with `x2x`.

<!--need GIF demo better though, but bit hard to do, 再看吧-->

<!--Basically you install x2x and openssh-server on the computer you want to control with another computer-->

<!--### Prerequisites-->
<!--Have `openssh-server` installed on your target computer ( the computer where your mouse and keyboard are not physically plugged in to )-->

<!--Debian based Linux-->
<!--```-->
<!--$ sudo apt install openssh-server-->
<!--```-->



### Install

Install `x2x` and `OpenSSH server` on the target computer ( the one where your keyboard and mouse is not physically connected to )

Debian based Linux
```
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
$ sudo aptitude install x2x
```

Arch based Linux
```
$ sudo pacman -S openssh
$ yay -S x2x-git
```


### Connect
Get target computer's IP by running this on target computer
```
$ hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

Connect to target computer from controlling computer
<!--( where your keyboard and mouse is plugged in to )-->
```
$ ssh -XC username@ip x2x -west -to :0.0
```
Note:
- replace `username` and `ip` accordingly
- depending on the left right positioning of your computers, change `west` to `east` if you need it

### Debug

You might get the error message
```
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
x2x - error: can not open display
```

Solution:

1.On the controlling computer, run

```
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2.Uncomment
`X11Forwarding yes` (or put it in if there isn't this line)

3.restart SSH server

### Done

You can now move your mouse cursor to your target computer, and type as if your mouse and keyboard is connected to the target computer too.
