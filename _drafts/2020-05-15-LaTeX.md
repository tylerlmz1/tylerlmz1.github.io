**This is a post about developing LaTeX documents with Vim + latexmk**

I'm very fond of using LaTeX to write PDF documents, the output is beautiful, I can develop documents in plain text so I can version control it with Git, so when it comes to documents that I'm the sole author, I prefer writing it with LaTeX.
<!--( because I can't expect my collaborators to know LaTeX too. )-->

There are multiple ways to develop LaTeX documents, for example Emacs, Visual Studio Code, Overleaf, etc.

I use GTRV + latexmk + Evince

Note: I use LaTeX in Linux so the tools here are for Linux

### LaTeX
first off, install LaTeX and latexmk

$ `sudo apt install texlive-full latexmk`

### GTRV
This is my development stack of Guake + Tmux + Ranger + Vim

### latexmk
`latexmk -pdf -pvc main.tex`

Run this to live compile main.tex on file change

### Evince
A decent pdf viewer to preview the output pdf.
