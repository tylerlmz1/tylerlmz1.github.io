<!--As of now, I use Vim as my primary text editor, it is popular among software professionals, and there are different ways to use it.-->
<!--Some use gvim, some use it in the terminal.-->

I use Vim in the terminal, in the combination of GTRV (Guake, Tmux, Ranger, Vim)

this is a short GIF of what the workflow looks like

### What each component provides

- Guake
  - a drop down terminal emulator
  - it provides window transparency so I can easily look through it to read the web page on the web browser to organize info into knowledge / run commands in the terminal.

- Tmux
  - A terminal multiplexer, housing multiple terminal sessions for me to easily jump around, it is sort of like a window manager like terminal sessions.

- Ranger
  - a terminal-based file manager to edit my files and folders with speed

- Vim
  - keyboard driven text editing software that edits text with speed

### Why is this nice
- Extensible
  - This set up uses the terminal as the base, which you can easily extend with so many commands, the potential ceiling is high.
