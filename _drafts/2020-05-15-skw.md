<!--I owe a lot to this idea by Steve Pavlina, his blog post about [Journaling as a Problem-Solving Tool](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/journaling-as-a-problem-solving-tool/)-->

<!--I came across a Chinese translated version of Steve Pavlina's blog post on [Journaling as a Problem-Solving Tool](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/journaling-as-a-problem-solving-tool/) around 2015, and it is one of the most influential ideas I've came across.-->

I came across Steve Pavlina's blog post on [Journaling as a Problem-Solving Tool](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/journaling-as-a-problem-solving-tool/) around 2015, and it is one of the most influential ideas I've came across, so much so that `Writing to think` is at the very core on how I work.

I'm not going to rehash the content mentioned in his blog post, instead I'm going to talk about how I take this idea to the next level with what I coined `ProductSkw Model`.

<!--The gist of his idea is that when we write things out, we can go beyond-->

After practicing this idea for years now, what I understood about it is that, when I write things out to think, I offload the burden of holding the content from my brain onto paper / text file, so my brain can focus on thinking, instead of diverting resource to hold the content that I just thought about.
